# Smart Shopper

Smart Shopper allows a user to search for contextually relevant products, share them with friends or add them to your Wish List. It uses the [Weather Underground APIs](http://theweatherapi.com/) to retrieve the current weather and searches for a relevant product using the [Walmart Labs APIs](http://github.com/walmartlabs/getting-started). It uses [Magnet Message](https://www.magnet.com/developer/magnet-message/) APIs to implement **Share a Product** and **Wish List** features.

**Note: ** Test API keys for Weather Underground, Walmart Labs and Magnet Message are included. But, it is strongly recommended to get your own API keys by following these links:
